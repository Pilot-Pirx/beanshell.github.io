		<h1>Wish List</h1>

		<h2>BeanShell Wish List</h2>

		<h3><em>
				Here are some areas we'd like to see addressed.
				We will be moving this stale list over to the issue tracking system or Wiki in
				the near future.
			</em></h3>

		Note: These are not necessarily in order of importance or difficulty. I'm
		just trying to catalog the goals for BeanShell. If you have other ideas,
		please submit them.

		<ul>
			<li><b>Job control</b> - It should be possible to stop a running script, at least when it is
				withing the interpreter's control.
			</li>

			<li><b>Additional byte-code compilation</b> - for improved performance where
				necesarry.</li>

			<li><b>Introspector Gadget</b> -
				GUI object inspector for the BeanShell Console/Desktop and beyond,
				allowing one to navigate through
				the object world and see methods/fields, threads, etc. in a visual way.
				If this were HTML based it could even be visible outside of the container.
			</li>

			<li><b>Standalone BeanShell Script Compiler</b> - Generate stand alone classes
				that bootstrap the interpreter, their own scripts, and perhaps perhaps stored
				state. We will like wish to support this in conjuction with the 2.0 release.
			</li>

			<li>Prompt feedback for multi-line commands on the command line - e.g.
				change the prompt to "&gt; " as in Bourne shell. I've made some attempts to
				get this working with help from the token manager, but had problems.
			</li>

		</ul>
