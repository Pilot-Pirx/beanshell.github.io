<h2>BeanShell Applet</h2>

<em>Note: bsh requires a Java 1.1 compliant web browser such as
	<a href="http://java.sun.com/">HotJava 1.0 or 1.1</a>,
	Netscape Navigator 4.03 or 4.04 with the
	<a href="http://developer.netscape.com/software/jdk/download.html">
		<strong>additional final 1.1 support patch</strong></a>, or the JDK 1.1.x
	appletviewer. I haven't seen the applet work with Netscape 4.05, MSIE 4.0+,
	or the JDK1.2 betas.
</em>
<p>

	Remember that as an applet bsh is limited by the applet security model.
	For full access to system resources you should
	<a href="download.html">download bsh</a> and run it stand-alone.
	<p>

		Tip: You can get a console window in an external frame at any time by typing:
		console() at the prompt. Use the editor() command for an editor window.
