    <h2>BeanShell Demos - Unsigned Applets</h2>
    <p>
        This page test the capability of BeanShell to run as an applet in
        an untrusted / secure environment.
        In this case the BeanShell interpreter is running within the JVM of your
        web browser and is therefore limited by the applet security policy.
        Not all features of BeanShell are available in this environment. In
        particular, applets are not allowed inspect non-public members of objects
        or to create classloaders. This means that the BeanShell interpreter, when
        running in an applet, can only access public methods of public APIs and cannot
        define its own classes. You *can*, on the other hand, create Java interfaces
        and BeanShell scripted objects.
        <p>

            These applets have been compiled with Java 1.3 and are bundled with the full
            distribution jar. However, BeanShell supports limited functionality
            for versions of Java as early as 1.1 and a smaller JAR size can be achieved
            by distributing only the core components.
            <p>

                <h3>Swing Desktop - Unsigned Applet</h3>
                To use the Swing based desktop in a separate top level frame. This requires
                the Java plug-in or other swing capable browser:

                        <h3>Swing JConsole - Unsigned Applet</h3>
                        To use a single Swing enabled console (shell) embedded in the page
                        with the Java plug-in or other swing capable browser:

                                <h3>AWT Console - Unsigned Applet</h3>
                                To use the minimal (not very good) AWT based console that should work in any
                                browser:
                                <p>
