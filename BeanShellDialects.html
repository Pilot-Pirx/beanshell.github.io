<h1>Proposal: Domain Syntax Methods (Dialects) for BeanShell</h1>

<p>
    <em>Note: This is just a very speculative proposal designed to elicit feedback.
        There are no plans to implement this or anything like it at this time.
        Finalizing the current release track has top priority.
    </em>
</p>

<p>There is a strong desire in any scripting language to add new syntax to support
    specialized domains such as regular expressions, shell functionality, XML
    parsing, SQL, etc. Providing this kind of specialized syntax is one of the
    main appeals of scripting languages. However as each new item is added to a
    language, the complexity of the grammar grows and each additional feature is
    forced to become more obscure and cryptic.
</p>

<p>What I would like to propose is an extensible mechanism for the BeanShell
    language that allows specialized "domain syntax" to be added in a way that is
    aesthetically appealing, Java-like, unambiguous with respect to reasonable
    developments in the Java language, and has almost no effect on the language
    when not used. The syntax mechanism should be pluggable, allowing
    developers to easily import their own syntax designs into the language in a
    way that encourages creativity, but still provides tight enough integration
    with the core language so as to be used productively and fluidly.
</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>The basic proposal here is to extend the notion of a method invocation in Java
    by allowing one or more arguments to have a "free-form", or non-Java syntax.
    These "domain syntax methods" or <em>dialects</em> would be responsible for
    more or less
    arbitrary parsing of their arguments but with certain required semantics that
    provide for tight integration with the surrounding BeanShell script
    environment. Domain methods would extend the concept of the BeanShell eval()
    method, both providing a traditional return value and producing side effects
    directly in the caller's scope. The existing eval() method would become a
    defacto, reflexive, BeanShell dialect.
</p>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p>Begin by considering the current eval() method, which takes a String argument
    and interprets it as BeanShell script code:
</p>

<table width="75%" bgcolor="#cccccc">
    <tr>
        <td>
            <pre>
value = eval( "foo=2; bar=3; someMethod();" );
</pre>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>
</p>

The eval() method does three things: 1) It executes the syntax in the string.
2) it produces a return value (in lieu of an explicit return it uses the last
value produced) and 3) it produces side effects. The eval() method is
<b>unlike</b> a
normal method in that it can produce side effects directly in the caller's
scope. For example:
</p>

<table width="75%" bgcolor="#cccccc">
    <tr>
        <td>
            <pre>
value = eval( "foo=2; bar=3; someMethod();");
print( foo ); // 2
</pre>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>
</p>

<p>Now consider what this might look like if we relaxed the requirement that the
    argument to eval() be a string and allowed it to be "free-form":
</p>

<p<>
    <table width="75%" bgcolor="#cccccc">
        <tr>
            <td>
                <pre>
value = eval( foo=2; bar=3; someMethod(); );

// or

value = eval( 
    foo=2; 
    bar=3; 
    someMethod(); 
);
</pre>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    </p>

    <p>Now, what if we allowed other kinds of "eval" methods to use arbitrary
        syntaxes? These "dialect" methods would need to be unambiguously identified,
        possibly through an explicit import. Here is a wildly speculative example:
    </p>

    <table width="75%" bgcolor="#cccccc">
        <tr>
            <td>
                <pre>
import bsh.regex;
...

String myString = "My name is Pat Niemeyer";

regex( 
     myString/s/Pat/Patrick/g
     myString/My name is (\w+) (\w+)/
     firstName = $1
     lastName = $2
);

print( firstName ); // Patrick
</pre>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p />

    The main things to notice in the snippet above are that: 1) the import
    unambiguously identifies the regex() domain syntax method. 2) the syntax
    within the bounds of the method invocation is completely domain specific
    (free-form) and may even by line-oriented, as shown above. 3) The syntax has
    full access to read values from the caller's environment and 4) the syntax
    produces eval-style side effects (variable assignments and method calls) in
    the caller's environment.
    </p>

    As you can see, for expanses of syntax of more than a single line or two, the
    burden of imposing the method call syntax regex(...); is not great. But,
    again, it serves two important purposes: to delineate the region of specialized
    syntax and to indicate to the programmer that something, possibly with a
    traditional return value, is being evaluated.
    <p />

    It is the fact that the new syntax can seamlessly work with values and methods
    from the caller's scope that makes this meaningful. <strong>These new dialects
        are embedded in BeanShell similar to the way in which BeanShell can be embedded
        in Java</strong>, via a transparent interpreter boundary. Java becomes the
    "base" language, BeanShell scales Java from static to dynamic, and dialects
    allow us to slip into and out of new syntax for as necessary for specific
    problems.
    <p />

    <h2>Examples</h2>
    By making these dialect methods pluggable (with strong requirements, see
    Implementation below) we can imagine all sorts of appealing additions to the
    language being created by independent developers. Here are some more
    speculative possibilities.
    <p />

    <table width="75%" bgcolor="#cccccc">
        <tr>
            <td>
                <pre>
// Implement a subset of Bourne Shell functionality
String myString = "Pat Niemeyer";
InputStream myStream = url.openStream();
File myFile = ...;

sh(
     cat stream > foo.txt
     lines=`grep "foo" myFile`
     echo $myString | someApplication
);

print(lines); // foo this foo that...
</pre>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p />

    <table width="75%" bgcolor="#cccccc">

            <td>
                <pre>

     open db://somedatabase
     select * from Foo where Bar

for ( row : rowset )
     print( row );

            </td>
        </tr>

    This is multi-line text 
        with a platform specific 
            line ending...

);

String myString = doc( "\n",
    Maybe this form specifies the line ending for
        long lines of text
            like this...
    Foo!
);

// Lists could work like this as well...
List myList = list( { 1, 2, { "foo", "bar" } } );
</pre>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>

list=list();

sh(
    cd /files
    foreach f in *.txt
    do 
        eval(
            String path = f.getCanonicalPath();
            list.add( new URL(path) );          
        );
    done;
);
</pre>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p />

    Again, the above are just suggestive of the ways we might use
    this capability. They are not meant as actual proposals.
    <p />


    <h2>Implementation</h2>

    </p>

    To support the pluggability (via import) of this kind of specialized syntax
    would
    require a lightweight pre-parsing stage, where the domain syntax is extracted
    and at the appropriate time fed to the plugin implementation. There would be
    some requirements on the dialect plugins including that they not
    conflict with the simple method invocation syntax (balanced parens), etc.
    Syntaxes that support variable assignment must work relative to the
    environment. Furthermore, syntaxes that support method invocation should allow
    nesting of dialects.
    <p />

    This could be supported in one of two ways: first, the plugin could simply be
    given an API paralleling that of the BeanShell namespace with set(), get() and
    eval() methods. More interestingly, perhaps the plugins could instead be
    required to generate a BeanShell script as output, which would then be
    evaluated using the standard eval() method. The script could be annotated with
    "source" information to allow for domain specific error line reporting.
    Working through a generated script layer would also preserve the possibility
    of compiling bsh scripts to a higher performance form in the future.
    <p />

    In either case, a framework would be developed providing as much support as
    possible for dialect plug-in writers. It should even be possible to implement
    simple dialects directly in BeanShell scripts without additional coding.
    In the extreme, we may wish to provide a simple LEX/YACC dialect as standard,
    which could use to implement small new grammars directly in scripts.
    </p>

    <h2>Problems with This Technique</h2>
    There are many possible issues with this proposal. Probably the largest is the
    difficulty that domain sytax will add to error reporting should it be used
    extensively. This problem plagued C++ when templates were first added to
    the language as a pre-compile step. When there is a layer of indirection it
    may be difficult for the user to understand the error messages. More
    specifically, there is the issue of simply determining the extent of the method
    invocations, should the domain syntax be corrupted. For example, unbalanced
    parentheses within the specialized syntax.
    <p />

    These problems should be weighed seriously. However, we should keep in mind
    that explicit import and the pluggability of these modules means that at worst,
    complications will only affect users who choose to use them and will not
    complicate the core language. Plugin writers can choose to implement very
    sophisticated parsing if they wish and should have access to the entire script
    body as necessary. Again, we may also be able to ameliorate this situation by
    providing powerful tools to aid the plugin writers.
    <p />


    <h2>Q&A</h2>

    <strong>
        Question: Why overload the syntax of a method call? Why not use a new syntax?
    </strong>
    <p />

    I'm open to suggestions on this, however here is my thinking. First, any
    new syntax would tend to fall into two categories: Java-like or deliberately
    non-Java-like. Non Java-like syntax, for example an XML CDATA section, would
    tend to be cumbersome and aesthetically unpleasing. Java-like syntax (for
    example using braces or <>) has the potential to be ambiguous with Java now and
        in the future. Extending the concept of a method call in this way is appealing
        for several reasons:
        <p />

        <ul>
            <li> In a sense it cannot conflict with Java because the basic construct is
                already Java.
            <li> Although these methods can have powerful additional semantics and
                side-effects, the syntax indicates to a novice user that at some level what they
                are seeing is just a Java method call with arguments and a return value. It
                provides a non-jarring, but well scoped region.
        </ul>
        <p />

        <strong>
            Question: Wouldn't reimplementing BeanShell in a meta-language be better?
        </strong>
        <p />
        In theory we could create a new, meta-language in which BeanShell and the Java
        syntax were simply an application and this would allow arbitrary new syntax to
        be implemented by users and combined in interesting ways. However I believe
        that this simpler, plugin based mechanism will be accessible to many more
        developers (normal programmers will be able to implement new syntax easily if
        they want to) and will still have has a high degree of integration with the
        core language through the eval-style semantics. Strong conventions or
        requirements for type usage will provide even greater cross-syntax integration
        when they are nested.
        <p />
