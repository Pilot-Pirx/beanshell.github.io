            <h3>BeanShell JSR Passes!</h3>

            <a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=274">JSR-274</a>
            the BeanShell Scripting Language, has
            <a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/results?id=3208">passed the voting process</a>
            with flying colors. This means that we will
            proceed with forming the expert group to write a language specification and
            work towards getting BeanShell included in the J2SE at some point in the
            future. Some <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/pat/archive/2005/05/jsr274_standard_1.html">comments</a>
            on the initiating the JSR can be found in Pat Niemeyer's
            blog on java.net.

            </p>
            <hr>
            I'm pleased to announce the opening of the
            <a href="https://github.com/beanshell/beanshell/wiki">BeanShell Community Wiki</a>.
            This is the first step in our migration to our new hosting site on <a
                href="https://github.com/beanshell/">GitHub</a>. There's not much there yet, but we expect
            you all to take care of that right away!

                <h3>BeanShell at JavaOne 2005</h3>
            </p>

            Join us for a BeanShell BOF session at JavaOne, 2005. The talk is tentatively
            titled <em><b>"The Future of BeanShell and Java Compatible Scripting"</b></em>.
            We'll also be cooperating with the JSR-223 session on the new
            <b>javax.script</b> API which will be bundled with an upcoming J2SE release.

            <h3>BeanShell 2.0 beta 1 Released!</h3>

            With version 2.0 BeanShell becomes a fully Java compatible scripting language.
            BeanShell is now capable of interpreting ordinary Java source and loading .java
            source files from the class path. BeanShell scripted classes are fully typed
            and appear to outside Java code and via reflective inspection as ordinary
            classes. However their implementation is fully dynamic and they may include
            arbitrary BeanShell scripts in their bodies, methods, and constructors. Users
            may now freely mix loose, unstructured BeanShell scripts, method closures, and
            full scripted classes. Please see the
            <a href="bsh20announce.txt">announcement</a> for details and known bugs
            in the initial release.

            <h3>BeanShell Support in Ant 1.5 and IBM Bean Scripting Framework
                2.3</h3>

            With version 1.5 Ant now provides explicit support for BeanShell as a
            pluggable scripting language via the BSF. Ironically, as of version 2.3 BSF now
            adds BeanShell support by registering it as one of its "well known"
            scripting languages. This means that you can use BeanShell in Ant 1.5 and

            also in any BSF aware application with BSF 2.3 (confusing enough?)

            I am happy to announce that
            <a href="http://www.bea.com/">Weblogic</a> will be making use of the
            licensing and shipping BeanShell with the Weblogic Server.

                <h3>Sun to Ship Beanshell with Forte for Java</h3>
            </p>
            I am pleased to officially announce that Sun will be shipping BeanShell
            with an upcoming release of
            <a href="http://www.sun.com/forte/">Forte for Java</a> and will make it
            available in the <a href="http://netbeans.apache.org">NetBeans IDE</a>.
            To facilitate this BeanShell has moved
            to a dual licensing arrangement. You may now opt to use BeanShell under
            the terms of the Sun Public License, or you may (as always) continue to
            use and develop BeanShell under the terms of the LGPL.
